    <h2>Mark Hammer</h2>
    <p>I am married with 3 kids. I live in Queen Creek, AZ.</p>
    <p>I am working on my first certificate towards an Applied Technology degree. 
        This is my 3rd semester as an online BYU-I student. I look forward to learning 
        more about HTML and CSS with you all this semester.</p>
    <p>I enjoy sports, video games, and taking naps whenever I can find the free time. There
        has not been a lot of free time since I started school though.</p>
    <p>I currently work for a software company in the education serviced department. We create 
        and manage the systems that our channel partners use to learn about our products.</p>
    <p> It is very nice to meet you all. I look forward to learning with you the rest of the semester.</p>
